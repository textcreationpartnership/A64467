            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some Scriptures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſlight view, ſeem as much at odds as the Poles, but the context or phraſe, the intent or time may ſo farre facilitate the agreement, that the whole Scripture may ſeem with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any doubting, to be a Web ſpun by the ſame hand. I am not ignorant, that the climbing up theſe Hills is a work both tedious and difficult, even the hardeſt Piece of Divinity, (other parts being delightfull Valleyes, whoſe variety of matter, and fruitfullneſſe in uſe will be ſufficient reward) this may advantage no further than cenſure and contempt; and though the iſſue be no other, yet it muſt not be neglected, in regard <hi>Atheiſts, Antiſcripturiſts, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> and the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>prophaneneſſe,</hi> make theſe ſeeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to be the <hi>Catholick</hi> Patron for their <hi>errors</hi> and practice.</p>
            <p>I had not adventured on theſe rough Billows, but that the <hi>Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> who formerly had cauſed the <hi>Reconciler</hi> to be Printed, (which was no more than <hi>Johannes Thaddaeus</hi> Tranſlated) finding that Book to be defective, both as to multitudes of places which were not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at all, and as to the obſcurity of ſeverall which were there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, he engaged me to make a Supplement, which might in ſome meaſure run parallel with the deſign. How I have performed you may beſt judg, when you have conſulted <hi>Magrio, Calvin,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hammond, Pezelius, Gerhard, Mayer, Muſculus, Mannaſſa Ben Iſrael, Lorinus, Willet,</hi> the <hi>Aſſembly, Diodat,</hi> &amp;c. Some on one, ſome on another place.</p>
            <p>The Quotations of Authors were forborne, to forbear abruption of ſenſe, and repeating of their very words; the ſubſtance being moſt an end reſerved, without an exact account of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> ſeems to have lighted his Candle conſtantly at

               <hi>Scorpius</hi> his Sun; what he omitted, is ſuperadded with the addition of the Authors own opinion, and yet leaving a juſt place for every mans own additionall Judgement. This may at the firſt ſeem a work of a few houres. Houſes are viewed at a glance, which when one conſiders in their ſeverall Materials, the Stone in the Quarry, the Beam in the Wood, the Lime in the Stone, the Workman in his Hewing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will take up the thoughts as of a larger extent. Books preſented as finiſhed, is an eaſie work for the eye and underſtanding: and yet the conſulting Authors, examining opinions, leaving of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, and taking what is fit, both is a labour to the head and hand: Its eaſier to read than compoſe Books, and as eaſie to cenſure as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

But for as much as the enemies of Divine truth are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to thoſe who continue in the ſame, it is no wonder that they fear not, both to reſiſt the Spirit by whom it was inſpired, and to accuſe the work of contrariety and imperfection. Though the Scripture have no reall contrarieties indeed in it ſelf, (for the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">2 Peter 1.21.

Some man perhaps will object, that ſome things are borrowed by me from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which I deny not; for in compiling this Synopſis, I thought it more ſafe and diſcreet, to follow the ſteps of the moſt approved <hi>Interpreters,</hi> than without the authority of <hi>famous men,</hi> in this moſt corrupt age,
<pb facs="tcp:100779:5"/> which is full of Error and Hereſie, to invert any thing of my own brain, and to publiſh it to the world. And I hope that the <hi>Courteuos Reader,</hi> and the equall cenſurer, are not ignorant, that in the ſtudy of Divinity, nothing can be ſaid now, that was not ſaid before. And it is moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.10 Aug. <hi>tom.</hi> 3. <hi>de Trin</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> that many Books ſhould be made by many men, of the ſame things, in a divers ſtyle, but not in a different <hi>faith.</hi> And he ſhall find that I have compendiouſly gathered together in this <hi>Concordance,</hi> that which the greater works of learned Men contained more at large; ſo that here he may, as it were at a ſingle view, comprehend the matter.

                        <hi>Abraham</hi> was tried to ſacrifice his ſonne, that ſo his dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might appear, not to God, but to the ages that ſhould be; for a mans mind oft-times cannot be known to himſelf, unleſſe he make tryall of his ſtrength, not by word but by deeds, when he is examined by temptation.</p>

'Tis true, that God may in a judiciary manner tempt man, or leave him to be tempted, withdrawing his grace from him.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.

As for the other difference which ſeemeth the more difficult, <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was but two and twenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> ſaith forty two years; and ſo this latter maketh him two years elder than his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100779:40"/> father, for his father began to reign when he was thirty two years old, and reigned eight years, and ſo died being forty, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.17. Now for the reconciling of this ſcruple, the Originall helpeth us, which in our Tranſlation is not viſible. The Originall meaneth thus. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was the ſon of the two and forty years, namely, of the houſe of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> of whoſe ſ ed he was by the Mothers ſide; and he walked in the wayes of that houſe, and came to run at the ſame time with it. This the Text directed us to look after, when it called his mother, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Omri,</hi> which was indeed the daughter of <hi>Ahab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The firſt place ſignifies, that there ſhould but a few of that people be ſaved from the Judgement which the Prophet there ſpeaks of; and though it were meant of eternall ſalvation, yet one of a City, and two of a Tribe being ſaved this week, and as many another, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the whole ſumme being caſt up will be great, if we conſider all times.

                  <p>Here we have need of a threefold reconciliation; <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt walking toward Sea, called <hi>Peter; Luke</hi> in a little ſhip: But <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of his firſt call; and <hi>Luke</hi> of his confirmation in it. 2. <hi>Matthew</hi> makes no mention of the Miracle, but what he let paſs, <hi>Luke</hi> deſcribes. 3. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls it, the ſea of <hi>Galilee, Luke,</hi> the Lake of <hi>Geneſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call all waters Seas: <hi>Matthew</hi> reſpects the Province, <hi>Luke,</hi> the banks by the next City.</p>

                  <p>This is not contrariety, but illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, one explains another; the ſtory at full in them all is thus: As Jeſus walked by the ſea of <hi>Geneſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> he ſaw two ſhips ſtanding there, the one whereof belonged to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> and the other to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> All theſe men being partners, had been fiſhing all night, but had caught nothing, and were not ſtepped down out of their ſhips to waſh their nets, Chriſt paſſed with multitudes on the ſhore, entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peters</hi> ſhip, and thence teacheth the people; and thence putting out a little into the Main, he helped <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to a miraculous draught of fiſhes, which was ſo unweildy, that he was glad to beckon up <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> from the ſhore to come and help them; the draught of fiſhes was got up and boated, and then <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> return to the ſhore again, and fall to mending their net, which was rent with helping at ſo great a draught. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeing what was done, adoreth Chriſt, and he and <hi>Andrew,</hi> being yet at ſea, are called by him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100779:75"/> for fiſhers of men, and bringing their ſhips to ſhore, they leave all and follow him. Chriſt and they coaſting a little further along the ſhore came to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he calleth them.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100779:76"/> latter place bids both Miniſter and people to avoid doing any thing for vain glory, for that hinders the glory of God. It is lawful to do good works before men to ſtir them up to do the like, and to praiſe God: but it is not lawful to do any work to have praiſe with men; it is one thing to do a good work to evidence to men our faith, when it is doubted and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men to be hypocritical: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to do a good work before men to make our hearts, which are hypocritical, to appear to be true.</p>

                  <p>The former place ſhews, Chriſt as God and man, came not to deſtroy that mandatory part of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the moral part; the mandatory part is Ceremonial, Judicial, and Moral. He hath not deſtroyed this laſt, though he hath fulfilled (ſo much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him) the firſt, ſecond, yea, &amp; the third. He came not to deſtroy that part of Gods Word, concerning Righteouſneſs and Juſtice, which <hi>Moſes</hi> penned by Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Prophets, <hi>i. e.</hi> That part of Gods Word which is contained in the writings of all the Prophets in the old Teſtament after <hi>Moſes;</hi> He came not either by his Doctrine or Practice to free men from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof, or to put an end to them ſo as they ſhould be uſeleſs: But he came to fulfil them, Firſt, By his Doctrine, 1. Reſtoring the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaning and true uſe. 2. And by revealing the right way. Secondly, By his Perſon he fulfilleth the Law, 1. By becoming accurſed to the Law. 2. And by perfect obedience unto the Law. Thirdly, He fulfilled the Law in the Elect by creating faith in Chriſt, and by giving them the Spirit of God. The ſecond place tels us, Chriſt is the end of the Law; He ended the Ceremonial Law, and legal Rites, the Law &amp; Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 11. He was the end of the Law, but not directly, for in general the Law was made to make man righteous, but ſeeing that could not be done, the Law brings us to Chriſt in whom we are righteous. 3. Chriſt is the end and ſcope aimed at, in the Old Teſtament all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets gave teſtimony of him. Chriſt he is the end, becauſe he perfectly fulfilled it: the Ceremonial Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance of it, the Moral Law by his active and paſſive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Chriſt is the end of the Law, as the Law is taken more largely for the whole Doctrine contained in <hi>Moſes, Joh.</hi> 5.46. Or ſecondly, as the Law is taken more ſtrictly for the Precepts of the Moral Law in three reſpects: 1. Of his perſonal obedience which the Law required. 2. In regard of ſatisfaction for the puniſhment due by the Law. 3. In juſtifying us by Chriſt, to whom the Law, as a Schoolmaſter, brings us.</p>

                  <p>Laws are Moral, Civil, or Politick; and among particular Laws are thoſe of permiſſion and toleration, which were ſuch as did not approve of evil, which they conceived, but did only tolerate and permit that evil which could not be avoyded, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of a greater evil which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would fall out, ſuch were thoſe Laws, <hi>Deu.</hi> 23.10.—21.15. This Law of divorce was not an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the giving a Bill of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce for every light cauſe, but tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of it, for the preventing of a greater miſchief, even murther: For the nature of the Jews was this; if a man once took diſlike to his wife, he would never be at reſt till he had ſhed her bloud if they might not be parted aſunder; this Law of divorce was only to reſtrain this evil. The Law did not allow a woman to put away her husband, becauſe there was no ſuch fear of blood, but the man to put away his wife. Beſides, the Law doth not bid a man put away his wife, but only permits it. The ſecond place ſpeaks of a malicious and willing departing of the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, which diſſolves the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but this is no cauſe of giving a Bill of divorce; only Adultery cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that. Here the beleever is a meer patient, and the divorce is made by the unbeleever, who unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaketh, and ſo puts away the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>The former place ſpeaks of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by divorce: The latter place of forſaking a wife, not by giving a Bill of divorcement, but that which

                  <p>The former ſpeaks of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of a divorce allowed by the Law permiſſively. The latter place ſpeaks of that Commandment which is not given to every private perſon, but to the Miniſters of the Church, who after one or two admonitions are to excommunicate, and cut off all Hereticks from the Church. Secondly, It hindereth not, but that the bond of marriage may remain ſure and firm, though one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be cut off from the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12.

                  <p>The former place bids us not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, or ariſe againſt the evil one, to requite like for like, according to the injury done unto us; It forbiddeth not reſiſting evil, for we may reſiſt evil by a lawful defence, as Chriſt did by lawful reaſoning; but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids reſiſting evil by private revenge; for he ſpeaketh to his Diſciples as to private men, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.27. The latter place ſhews an example of Chriſts reaſoning with them about evil offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, but not of his reſiſting evil with evil, ſmiting with ſmiting, but readineſs to ſuffer more, or turn the other cheek.</p>

                  <p>Revenge is twofold, private, or publick: Private, when thoſe who are no Magiſtrates will revenge themſelves on ſuch as do them wrong: Inſtead of pardoning, they reſiſt and revenge themſelves.

The former place is of private, the latter of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick revenge. There are two kinds of injuries: Firſt, for which reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be made.

There is a revenge which belongs to mercy, which is not to be underſtood in the former, in that which availeth to correction: This belongs to them which have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for they ought to revenge, but with ſuch a mind as Parents bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their little Children, whom they hate not.

                  <p>The former forbids not the going to law, but the wronged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf: to wit, being injured in his goods, either privately, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Law. The latter ſhews that Magiſtracy is the Ordinance of God, and it may be uſed lawfully. The former place is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſimply, but comparatively: to wit, rather than a man ſhould ſeek private revenge, he muſt not only ſuffer the loſs of one garment, but of more.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt doth here preſcribe the law of patience to his followers; that they ſhould not be troubled for the loſs of their goods, but wait on the Lord quietly, untill he take revenge on wicked men: yet he forbids not the lawful means of recovering goods, fraudulently or forcibly taken away, or appeal to the Magiſtrate for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, much leſs doth he condemn it.</p>

                  <p>The firſt place was meant of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Miracles eſpecially; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, of preaching the Word.

That is, in one of the Cities: or its Sabbaths, that is, the ſecond Sabbath after the firſt; which if ſo, it belongs to one of their Feſtivals, in their great fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals, as their Paſchal, Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles and Dedication; the firſt day was moſt holy, the reſt to the laſt not ſo renowned, yet all were called Sabbath, although it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on ſuch daies to provide victuals; it was called the ſecond Sabbath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt, becauſe it was the ſecond from that renowned and great Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and that firſt great Sabbath of thoſe which followed. So as he who walked the ſecond day from the Sabbath, according to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> walked on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and as <hi>Luke,</hi> the ſecond Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after the firſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is probable that the Jews at firſt obſerved Chriſt whether he would heal or no, and after he had healed the man, they ask him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not; and he by way of anſwer asks them, whether it were lawful to do good on the Sabbath? And though <hi>Matthew</hi> do place the words before the healing, yet there may be an anticipation. Or elſe thus, that while they obſerved him, he deferring to do any thing, they broke out into this queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? Which might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a queſtion ſimply moved to learn of him, but it is ſaid, that he knew their thoughts, and that they had a mind in them to cavil with him for his Queſtion to them, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawful to do good, or to do evil upon the Sabbath day? It agreeth fitly to the occaſion, for the not helping a man in miſery, is to do evil at any time in him that hath power to help; not to ſave life, when a man can, is to kill.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews had an opinion, that reſt on the Sabbath (as I conceive) muſt be ſo large, as no work at all muſt be done on it.

                  <p>We find the agreement thus: Chriſt knew (ſaith <hi>Matthew</hi>) their diſputing in their thoughts. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, they diſputed this by the way. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, Chriſt called the Diſciples: <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, they came, implying, when they were called; and <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, they asked Chriſt <hi>Who is the greateſt?

                  <p>God is good of his own infinite perfection, by his Eſſence, Nature, and Beeing, to whom evil is contrary. Men and Angels are called good, not from themſelves, but by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the goodneſs of God in their creation and reſtitution.

                  <p>Chriſt doth not in this place deny himſelf to be God, but he applies himſelf to the perſon to whom he ſpake; he reprehends his hypocriſie, though he ſpake the truth, yet he was reproved for not ſpeaking it with a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100779:85"/> true heart; for as ſome gather by his ſudden departure he came to catch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to obey, and yet ſome of the ancient Fathers do think Chriſt reproved him of pride of his own righteouſneſs; However this is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronical, not a negative ſpeech. There is a great diſtance betwixt theſe— <hi>Do not call me good,</hi> and <hi>Why calleſt thou me good?</hi> The former denies goodneſs to be in him; The latter only ſeems to expoſtulate the matter thus, Why doſt thou call me good, ſeeing thou doſt not believe me to be God, nor art reſolved to follow my Doctrine?</p>

And as for <hi>Luke</hi> telling that it was done when they were about to enter <hi>Jericho,</hi> I think they did cry unto him when he was to enter, but being hindered by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and noyſe of the people, could not be heard, wherefore they ſtood in ſome more convenient place about the time of his going out, and then crying unto him prevailed: But <hi>Luke,</hi> content only to ſupply what is wanting in the other Evangeliſts, ſpeaketh of no more but the crying to him when he entred, and ſo cometh directly to the Miracle; And this is the more probable, becauſe Chriſt oftentimes was wont to delay men ſeeking to him, for the tryal of their faith.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Many called by Gods revealed Will, or that of his Precept, but not choſen by his private, or the will of his purpoſe, for few are choſen by that. God would have all men ſaved, all ſorts of men, not every particular man, but of all conditions of men, poor, and rich, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The former place is but Paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and ſo not argumentative. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Text tels us only they knew him with an head knowledge, as the devils knew, that is, were perſwaded by his Works and Miracles, he muſt needs be the Chriſt, but they knew not ſavingly or feelingly that he was the Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The latter Text is a Text of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> looking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his former eſtate of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pronounced, thinking that no man would be ſo baſe as to perſecute and kill the Son of God, if he knew that he was the Son of God. But this Judgment of charity doth not affirm, that there will be none who will ſin preſumptuouſly, and againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as probably they did in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>

                  <p>A Chriſtian is free from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law, and from the damning power of the Moral Law, (as he is in Chriſt) and he is free from the power of ſin, that is, free from ſins damnation, and free from ſins dominion, <hi>i. e.</hi> when he begins to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Lord enables him more freely to reſiſt ſin than formerly, and ſo day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlargeth his heart, till in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion this freedom is perfected; and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> might ſpeak of his being in his own apprehenſion ſo troubled with ſin as if he were ſold under it, though he were in part free, and was going on to perfect freedom from ſin. It is one thing what Chriſt ſpake as to the right and portion of a Chriſtian, another thing what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks out of his hatred and deteſtation of the weight and luſting of ſin within him. A child of God takes the longing of his ſpirit after ſins grievouſly, and complains he is ſold under ſin when he finds ſin ſtrongly tempt him.</p>

                  <p>No man can bring a clean thing by perſonal and inherent cleanneſs out of a ſoyl that is inherently unclean; Though a perſon under the external priviledges of holineſs, called a branch, may yet be unclean in himſelf, and ſo bring forth nothing but unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>This word <hi>Paenitere,</hi> to repent, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken two waies, either properly, and ſo it ſignifieth a change of the mind and purpoſe, which wiſheth a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and not to be, which is: and in this ſence God cannot repent him of any thing which he hath done, nor of any gifts beſtowed, no not upon the wicked: For howſoever they abuſe them ungratiouſly, yet the Lord had reaſon to do as he did: He that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, either faileth in his counſel, not foreſeeing all things, or in his power, not being able to effect what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but God hath no defect either in counſel or power, therefore properly he cannot repent. 2. To repent ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a change, not in him that willeth and purpoſeth, but in the thing willed, and ſo God is ſaid to repent, not that he changeth, but they change and alter upon whom the gifts are conferred, and ſhew themſelves unworthy of them, ſo here is a Metonymy of the effect for the cauſe — Neither are all Gods gifts without repentance, but ſuch gifts as depend upon Election: Neither is every Vocation unchangeable, but only the internal and ſpiritual. God had choſen <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, and furniſhed him with excellent gifts, but they were only temporal: Though he had a temporal Election to the Kingdom, it follows not that he was eternally elected; for God had decreed or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould not continue in the Kingdom appointed unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>

                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaies not, he thanked God he baptized none at all, but none except <hi>Criſpus,</hi> &amp;c. for if he had thought baptizing unlawful he would not have baptized them; but he thanks God he baptized no more, in regard they made the being baptized by ſuch and ſuch perſons to be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their Diviſions, one being of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and upon this account he bleſſeth God. When he ſaith, Chriſt ſent him not to baptize, he doth not mean not to baptize at all, (for he confeſſeth he did baptize <hi>Criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> &amp;c.) but that baptizing was not his principal work, though Chriſt ſent all the Apoſtles to baptize as well as to preach, yet not ſo the one as the other.</p>

                  <p>In the Apoſtolical Miniſtration the leſs principal was to baptize; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal was the preaching of the Goſpel, and that was ordinary, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>

                  <p>The firſt place is of the ſalvation of the ſoul, which is done by the Goſpel: The latter is of the cure of the body, which is wrought by divers means, ordinarily by the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, extraordinarily by other means.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt is called the wiſdom of God, not as if the Father had no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of himſelf, or had no perſonal abilities of knowledge; The Son is called Wiſdom as he is called the Word.

Chriſt is that perſon that reveals the ſecret wiſdom of God to us, by which he would have us brought to ſalvation, and ſo he is called the power of God; not that the Father is weak, and the Son only ſtrong, but Chriſt is the perſon by whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powerfully and effectually gathers his Church, and raiſeth the dead.</p>

                  <p>Calling is twofold, external and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ordinary or extraordinary, common or ſpiritual and effectual; not many wiſe (as the world counts wiſe men) are called effectually, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and ſavingly. Or Chriſt calls not all to him, he calls all the weary: All wiſe men and mighty men are not weary men, there are not many wiſe that are weary.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When we are ſent to the Law it is in reference to Chriſt, the Law and Prophets teſtifie of Chriſt, and are ſchool-maſters to bring us to Chriſt; Therefore the Apoſtle might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to know nothing but Chriſt, and yet know the Law and Prophets in relation to Chriſt, and ſo he might know other things in that reſpect.</p>

                  <p>Perfection in the former place is not meant ſimply, but comparatively; the Apoſtle calls them perfect here, not thoſe who wanted no perfection, but ſuch as are ſo in reſpect of novices in the Church.
